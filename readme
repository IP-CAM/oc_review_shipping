 This vqmod adds a checkbox to step 5 of the checkout process. It forces the customer to review the shipping terms in the event that there are exceptions the store owner wants to make clear.

 This mod adds a selection tab to the admin settings area where you can set the page that you want a customer to review before moving on to the payment portion of the checkout process.

 This is a VQmod and it does not change any of the core files.
