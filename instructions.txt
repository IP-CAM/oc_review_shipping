1. Backup your OpenCart installation, just to be safe.


2. Make sure vQmod is installed. If you do not have vQmod installed, you can
download it for free from www.vqmod.com


3. Using an FTP application, upload the contents of the "upload" folder to
the root of your OpenCart installation. No core files are overwritten. For
further information on how to upload files via FTP, view this forum topic:

4. Log in to the admin page of your opencart store and go to system/settings/edit. Click on the Option tab. Scroll down to the Checkout section and under the Shipping Terms section select the page you would like the forced review page to display.

That's it! Enjoy!
